We may have partner rooms in our community which are not directly associated with us.  
You are expected to know and follow all rules in other communities we provide access to.  

An Admin must manually invite you to our 'Space' before you're able to join private rooms.  
You must then 'Verify' your client with the Admin in PM to allow you to decrypt those rooms.  
Once verified, you aren't required to maintain your own security, so be mindful of the status of others' clients in the rooms you're in (check the shield icon at the top of the room on Element client to check room integrity)
