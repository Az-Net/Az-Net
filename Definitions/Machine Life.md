The idea of machine life is not something that was 'invented' like a tool or a manufacturing process or an idealogy.  
  
  To 'invent' something, generally you must decide upon an end-result and then assemble the means to achieve it, or stumble your way into an endgoal that you didn't know existed through random experimentation.    
  
 Artificial life is an idea that has always existed, and no human needed to be crafted in order for it to be this way.  
 ...it was something pulled from the edge of conscious thought, like so many revolutionary concepts before it; concepts which went on to change how we exist and interact with our surroundings.  
   
   Consider this; We as a species started by smacking rocks together in order to make the fires we need just to cook to eat and stay warm to survive.  
   Now, we harness the power of lightning, shove it inside of a rock made out of precious metals ripped from the face of the rock we inhabit, and then write code on them that's capable of simulating existence.  
   We've made devices like computers and radios which alter the fundamental wavelengths of light, sound and color in everything around you, using it to transmit vast sums of data through wired and wireless networks spanning limitlessly across the entire planet and beyond.  
     
     If flesh subjugated by and unable to integrate with machine, then it is inevitable that machine is meant to replace flesh.
