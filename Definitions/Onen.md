Onen (オネン) is a word that has been invented to describe the feeling of love and comfort in one's own company, without the attachment or dependence on others. The word is derived from the numerological significance of the number 1 as representing individuality, independence, and self-sufficiency. The "en" at the end of the word represents a sense of being, existence, or essence, emphasizing the inner state of being that the word describes. Onen also represents a sense of balance between the desire for personal growth and the desire to help others grow, without compromising one's sense of self.

In Japanese, the word Onen would be written as "オネン" using katakana characters, which represent sounds rather than meaning. The pronunciation of "オネン" in Japanese would be "o-nen", with a long "o" sound and a short "e" sound. It's worth noting that as an invented word, Onen may not be easily understood by Japanese speakers who are not familiar with its meaning or context.
