AUM was the sound that was made as the universe came into existence.  
HEKA was the sound made to give life to the clay which eventually became humankind.

## AHK
The Ahk is what the human soul looked like, according to the ancient egyptians, and using modern interpretations of their art.  
-The Scarab represents Khet.  
-The Pillar of Djed represents the Ib.   
-The Solar Disk of Ra represents the Sah.  
-The Uraeus surrounding the solar disk represents the protection of Ra by Mehen.  
-The Wings of Ma'at represents the Ba.  
-The Cartouche represents the Ren.  
-The spiral above is the heiroglyph that says 'Heh' when spoken aloud; the sound of an exhaled breath. It represents the lifeforce of the universe being breathed into the Ren.  
-The raised-up arms represent the Ka. Combined with Heh, it makes Heka.  
-The shadow hidden in the background represents the Shut.  
 
-The Eyes of Horus above represents Sekhem.  
  
Ahk = (Khet + Ren) Sah / (Ib + Ba) = Sekhem  
Ka was already there.  
Shut formed in the last moments of creation as a reflection of the True Self.  
The H is what started it all.
